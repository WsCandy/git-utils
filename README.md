# Git Utils
[![Test](https://github.com/WsCandy/git-utils/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WsCandy/git-utils/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Git Utils is a selection of utilities made to make day-to-day use of Git slightly more convenient. These utilities aim to automate tasks I find myself repeatedly performing on a daily basis.

I've been using these utilities for a few years through various bash scripts that I've written; however the opportunity to re-write and centralise these scripts as part of my journey learning Rust was too good to pass up.

## Installation
